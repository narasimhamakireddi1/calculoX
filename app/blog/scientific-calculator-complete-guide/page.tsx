## Engine 1: Standard Math Mode

**Use Case:** Physics, engineering, advanced mathematics

**Supported Functions:**
\`\`\`
Basic: +, −, ×, ÷, ^ (power), % (modulo)
Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
Hyperbolic: sinh, cosh, tanh
Logarithms: log (base 10), ln (natural log), log₂ (base 2)
Advanced: √x, ∛x (cube root), x!, nCr, nPr, |x| (absolute)
Constants: π, e, Ans (previous result), M (memory)
\`\`\`

### Angle Modes
- **DEG (Degrees):** sin(45°) = 0.707 (everyday use)
- **RAD (Radians):** sin(π/4) = 0.707 (physics/engineering)
- Toggle between modes with DEG/RAD button

### Real Example 1: Physics - Projectile Motion
**Find: How far does a projectile travel at 45° angle with initial velocity 20 m/s?**

\`\`\`
Range = (v² × sin(2θ)) / g
where v=20, θ=45°, g=9.8

Calculation:
sin(2 × 45°) = sin(90°) = 1
Range = (20² × 1) / 9.8
Range = 400 / 9.8 = 40.82 meters

Steps: 20 ^ 2 → 400 | 2 × 45 = 90 | sin(90) = 1 | 400 ÷ 9.8 = 40.82
\`\`\`

### Real Example 2: Engineering - Logarithmic Calculations
**Find: Decibel gain with power input 100W, output 1000W**

\`\`\`
Gain (dB) = 10 × log₁₀(Output/Input)
Gain = 10 × log₁₀(1000/100)
Gain = 10 × log₁₀(10)
Gain = 10 × 1
Gain = 10 dB

Steps: 1000 ÷ 100 = 10 | log(10) = 1 | 10 × 1 = 10
\`\`\`

### Real Example 3: Combinations & Permutations
**Find: Number of ways to arrange 5 people in a line**

\`\`\`
Answer = 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Steps: 5 → [!] → 120
\`\`\`

---

## Engine 2: Complex Numbers Mode

**Use Case:** Electrical engineering (AC circuits), advanced physics, control systems

**Operations with Complex Numbers (a + bi):**
\`\`\`
Addition: (3+4i) + (2+5i) = 5+9i
Subtraction: (5+6i) − (2+3i) = 3+3i
Multiplication: (2+3i) × (4+5i) = −7+22i
Division: (6+8i) ÷ (2+1i) = 4+2i
\`\`\`

### Real Example 1: AC Circuit - Impedance Calculation
**Find: Total impedance of resistor (R=10Ω) in series with capacitor (Xc=5Ω)**

\`\`\`
Impedance Z = R − jXc = 10 − 5i

Magnitude: |Z| = √(10² + 5²) = √125 = 11.18Ω
Phase: θ = arctan(-5/10) = -26.57°

Using Calculator:
1. Enter: 10 − 5i
2. Calculate magnitude: √(10² + 5²) = 11.18
3. Find phase angle: atan(-5/10) = -26.57°
\`\`\`

### Real Example 2: Complex Number Division
**Calculate: (6+8i) ÷ (2+1i)**

\`\`\`
Manual method:
(6+8i) / (2+1i) × (2−1i) / (2−1i)
= (6+8i)(2−1i) / (2² + 1²)
= (12 − 6i + 16i + 8) / 5
= (20 + 10i) / 5
= 4 + 2i

Using Calculator: Enter 6+8i | ÷ | 2+1i | = → 4+2i
\`\`\`

## Engine 3: Matrix Operations Mode

**Use Case:** Linear algebra, physics simulations, computer graphics, data transformations

**Supported Operations (2×2 and 3×3 matrices):**
\`\`\`
Matrix A, Matrix B: User-defined 2×2 or 3×3 grids
Operations: det(A), inv(A), T(A), A+B, A×B
\`\`\`

### Real Example 1: Determinant of 2×2 Matrix
**Matrix A = [[3, 2], [1, 4]], Find: det(A)**

\`\`\`
Matrix A:
| 3  2 |
| 1  4 |

det(A) = (3×4) − (2×1) = 12 − 2 = 10

If det(A) ≠ 0, matrix is invertible
If det(A) = 0, matrix is singular (no inverse)
\`\`\`

### Real Example 2: Matrix Inverse (2×2)
**Matrix A = [[4, 7], [2, 6]], Find: A⁻¹**

\`\`\`
Step 1: Find determinant
det(A) = (4×6) − (7×2) = 24 − 14 = 10

Step 2: Apply formula
A⁻¹ = (1/det) × [[d, −b], [−c, a]]
A⁻¹ = (1/10) × [[6, −7], [−2, 4]]
A⁻¹ = [[0.6, −0.7], [−0.2, 0.4]]

Using Calculator:
1. Enter Matrix A values: 4, 7, 2, 6
2. Click inv(A) → Result shows A⁻¹
\`\`\`

### Real Example 3: Matrix Multiplication
**A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]], Find: A × B**

\`\`\`
A × B:
| 1  2 |   | 5  6 |   | (1×5+2×7)  (1×6+2×8) |   | 19  22 |
| 3  4 | × | 7  8 | = | (3×5+4×7)  (3×6+4×8) | = | 43  50 |

Using Calculator:
1. Enter Matrix A and Matrix B values
2. Click A × B → Result: [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
\`\`\`

## Engine 4: Statistics & Regression Mode

**Use Case:** Data analysis, business forecasting, scientific research, trend analysis

**Supported Operations:**
\`\`\`
Data Entry: X and Y value pairs (up to 20 rows)
Analysis: n (count), mean (average), standard deviation (σ)
Regression: Linear equation y = mx + b, R² coefficient
\`\`\`

### Real Example 1: Simple Linear Regression
**Data: Student study hours (X) vs test scores (Y)**

\`\`\`
Data Points:
X (Hours) | Y (Score)
    2     |    50
    4     |    65
    6     |    75
    8     |    85

Analysis Results:
n = 4 (4 data points)
X̄ (mean hours) = 5
Ȳ (mean score) = 68.75
σ_x = 2.236 hours
σ_y = 12.5 points

Regression Line:
y = 8.75x + 25
(For every 1 hour increase, score increases 8.75 points)

R² = 0.985 (99.5% correlation — very strong fit)

Prediction: If student studies 5 hours, expected score:
y = 8.75(5) + 25 = 68.75
\`\`\`

### Real Example 2: Sales Forecasting
**Monthly Sales Data (Last 6 months)**

\`\`\`
Month (X) | Sales (₹ Lakhs)
    1     |      5
    2     |      6
    3     |      7.5
    4     |      8.5
    5     |      10
    6     |      11.5

Regression Analysis:
Equation: y = 1.3x + 3.83
R² = 0.996 (excellent fit)

Forecast for Month 7:
y = 1.3(7) + 3.83 = 13.93 lakhs

Interpretation: Sales growing consistently at ~₹1.3L per month

Numbers:    0-9, . (decimal point)
Operators:  + − * / ^ (power) % (modulo)
Functions:  ( ) (parentheses for order of operations)
Actions:    Enter (calculate), Backspace (delete), Escape (clear all)

Examples:
  2+3*4 → [Enter] → 14 (not 20, respects PEMDAS)
  sin(45) → [Enter] → 0.707 (with DEG mode)
  2^10 → [Enter] → 1024
  10! → [Enter] → 3,628,800
\`\`\`

### SHIFT Modifier
- **Standard Mode:** Toggle inverse functions (sin ↔ asin, log ↔ 10^x, etc.)
- **Usage:** Press SHIFT, then click desired function
- Example: For asin(0.5), press SHIFT → sin → 0.5 → = → 30°

### Memory Features
- **M+:** Add displayed result to memory
- **M−:** Subtract displayed result from memory
- **MC:** Clear memory (set to 0)
- **MR:** Recall memory value and use in calculation
- **Usage Example:** Store ₹500 (M+), add ₹300 (M+), recall total (MR) → ₹800

## Common Scientific Calculator Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Forgetting to Toggle Angle Mode
**Wrong:** Calculating sin(45) in RAD mode → gets 0.8509 (radians)
**Correct:** Switch to DEG mode first → sin(45°) → 0.707

### ❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Order of Operations
**Wrong:** 2 + 3 × 4 = 20 (adding left to right)
**Correct:** 2 + 3 × 4 = 14 (multiply first, then add)

### ❌ Mistake 3: Misunderstanding Matrix Multiplication Order
**Wrong:** A × B = B × A (matrix multiplication is NOT commutative)
**Correct:** Always specify order explicitly

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting Parentheses
**Wrong:** 1 ÷ 2 + 3 = 3.5
**Correct:** 1 ÷ (2 + 3) = 0.2 (parentheses change result)

### ❌ Mistake 5: Confusing Correlation with Causation
**Wrong:** High R² means X causes Y
**Correct:** R² only shows how well data fits linear model, not causality

## Advanced Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Chain Calculations
Don't clear between steps. Use Ans (previous result) to build complex formulas.

\`\`\`
Example: Calculate √(25) + 3, then multiply by 2
√(25) → [Enter] → 5 (stored as Ans)
Ans + 3 → [Enter] → 8
Ans × 2 → [Enter] → 16
\`\`\`

### Tip 2: Convert Between Angle Units
Use trig functions to convert:
- Degrees to Radians: 45° × π ÷ 180 = 0.785 rad
- Radians to Degrees: 0.785 × 180 ÷ π = 45°

### Tip 3: Use Factorial for Probability
Combinations = n! ÷ (k! × (n−k)!)
Permutations = n! ÷ (n−r)!

### Tip 4: Check Matrix Invertibility
Before calculating inv(A), verify det(A) ≠ 0. If det = 0, no inverse exists.

### Tip 5: Interpret R² Correctly
- R² = 0.95 → 95% of variance explained by model (excellent)
- R² = 0.70 → 70% explained (good)
- R² = 0.50 → 50% explained (moderate, consider other factors)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between DEG and RAD mode?**
A: DEG (Degrees) is intuitive: 90° is a right angle. RAD (Radians) is mathematical: π/2 is a right angle. Engineering uses DEG; physics often uses RAD. Always check your mode before trigonometry!

**Q: Can I do complex calculations in one expression?**
A: Yes! Use parentheses: (2+3)×(4−1) = 15. Calculator respects PEMDAS order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

**Q: What if matrix determinant is zero?**
A: Matrix is singular (non-invertible). No unique solution exists. This often means the matrix has linearly dependent rows or columns.

**Q: How do I know if linear regression is accurate?**
A: Check R² value. R² > 0.9 is excellent, 0.7−0.9 is good, < 0.5 is weak. Also examine the scatter plot — if points don't follow a line, regression may be inappropriate.

**Q: Can I save calculations or create a formula library?**
A: History panel stores last 10 calculations. Click any historical calculation to re-run or modify it. For repetitive formulas, write them as expressions: e.g., "(a²+b²)" reused with different a,b values.

    faqs: [
      {
        question: 'Why do I get different results in DEG vs RAD mode?',
        answer: 'Degrees and radians measure angles differently. 90° = π/2 rad. sin(90°) = 1, but sin(90 rad) ≠ 1. Always set correct mode before trigonometry. Most everyday use is DEG; physics/engineering uses RAD.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What does R² mean in regression analysis?',
        answer: 'R² (coefficient of determination) shows how well data fits the linear model. R²=0.95 means 95% of variation is explained. Range: 0 to 1. Higher = better fit. But R² doesn\'t prove causation, only correlation.'
      },
      {
        question: 'When should I use matrix operations?',
        answer: 'Matrices solve systems of linear equations, transform coordinates (graphics), and represent transformations (engineering). If problem involves multiple equations with multiple unknowns, or geometric transformations, matrices are ideal.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I calculate complex number division easily?',
        answer: 'Yes, enter (a+bi) ÷ (c+di) and calculator handles conjugate multiplication internally. Manual method requires multiplying by conjugate, but scientific mode automates this.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s the fastest way to calculate factorial (n!)?',
        answer: 'Press n → [!] button. For example: 7 → [!] → 5040. For mental math, remember: 5!=120, 10!=3,628,800. Factorials grow extremely fast (20! is over 2 trillion).'
